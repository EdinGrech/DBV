-there are comments on the code but not much to go off of, they are mostly my notes to keep track where I am at

What the program can do:
-allows user to create tables in any file format (that uses 2 separators, example .txt .csv)
=it can also extract information form saved file and be interpreted
-the program is designed to be piped meaning it cam be imported as a substructure for other programs to interface with it although this feature is still a work in progress
-the program allows for mass table manipulation that can also be specified if nessicery
-it also has a basic ui but can be kept a sleep in needed when it is connected to a better gui in future

features to be added/improved soon:
-remove files (soon os errors need fixing)
-reader/writer optimizations
-writer can flip the fields horizontally or vertically for saving
-relating ui needs to be implemented and linked to current relational functions
-Table Views need to be implemented (create,save,edit,remove)
-Views will be able to be given permition attributes and there should be a filing system implemented (maybe dabil into security more)
-fully understand the sorting source code and optimize it,
-make the basic ui more stream line OR start working on the main gui and make that the actual stream line ui
